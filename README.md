For example; Love Running is a site that hopes to help keep people motivated to meet up for runs on a regular basis in Dublin, Ireland.

## Features 
The game keeps track of the current riddle index and the user's score. The displayRiddle() function is used to show the current riddle to the user and reset the input field.
When the user submits an answer, the checkAnswer() function is called. It compares the user's answer to the correct answer for the current riddle. If the user is correct, their score is incremented, and the next unsolved riddle is displayed. If all riddles have been solved, the game is reset. If the user is incorrect, a hint is displayed, and the answer is marked as incorrect.
