# Riddle Game

### Can you solve these riddles to win the game?
In this game, you'll face a series of riddles that will test your wit and cunning. Each riddle is defined in an array along with hints and answers. Your goal is to answer as many riddles as you can correctly to win the game.


In this section, you will include one or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Essentially, this part is your sales pitch. At this stage, you should have a name for your project so use it! Don’t introduce the project as a Portfolio project for the diploma. In this section, describe what the project hopes to accomplish, who it is intended to target and how it will be useful to the target audience. 

For example; Love Running is a site that hopes to help keep people motivated to meet up for runs on a regular basis in Dublin, Ireland. The site will be targeted toward runners who are looking for a way to socialise and keep themselves fit. Love Running will be useful for runners to see exactly when and where they should be to join the running club. 


## Features 
The game keeps track of the current riddle index and the user's score. The displayRiddle() function is used to show the current riddle to the user and reset the input field.
When the user submits an answer, the checkAnswer() function is called. It compares the user's answer to the correct answer for the current riddle. If the user is correct, their score is incremented, and the next unsolved riddle is displayed. If all riddles have been solved, the game is reset. If the user is incorrect, a hint is displayed, and the answer is marked as incorrect.
